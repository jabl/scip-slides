#+Title: Debugging code

* Scope
  - My code compiles, but... when I run it, it just says "Segmentation fault"
    - Help?!
  - This is about how to compile C/C++/Fortran/etc. code
    - python/R/Matlab etc. extensions have their own debuggers. 
      - Basic principles the same, details differ.

** A little aside...

   - Should you really be writing C/C++/Fortran, in 2016?
     - If you have to extend/maintain existing code, sure..
     - But for new code?
   - C wasn't state of the art in 1972, even less so today..
     - Lack of memory safety
     - Undefined- and implementation-defined behavior everywhere
     - Lots of gotchas, e.g. wrt. alias analysis, signed overflow.
   - C++ inherits the C mess
   - Fortran is a little better, but not much
