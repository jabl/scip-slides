* Some common problems with Slurm

  - Why is my job never scheduled?
  - What do these cryptic "Reason" things mean?

* Reason for queuing jobs

  - See the list of pending jobs with "squeue -t PD"
  - The last column, "NODELIST (REASON)" shows why the job isn't running
  - Open the manual page for squeue with "man squeue"
    - See the section "JOB REASON CODES" towards the end
      - The list is NOT exhaustive

** The most common reason codes

   - Priority: There is another pending job with higher priority
   - Resources: The job has the highest priority, but waiting for
     resources to become available, that is, for some running job to
     finish.
   - AssocMaxJobsLimit: The association (=user/group) has a limit on
     the number of resources (e.g. GPU's) that can be used by running
     jobs. You must wait for some of your running jobs to finish
     before this one can be started.
   - launch failed requeued held: Job launch failed, slurm requeued
     the job but it must be released with "scontrol release JOBID"
   - Dependency: Job cannot start before some other job is finished.
   - DependencyNeverSatisfied: Job cannot start before some other job
     is finished, but that other job failed. You must cancel the job
     with "scancel JOBID"
